# Pokemon Icons for Notion

This repo hosts processed Pokémon box sprites that can be used as page icons in Notion databases.

## The Goal

All Pokémon pages in Notion should have **big, consistent, centered** page icons—and they should not be cut off by cropping.

### Current Processing Pipeline

All sprites: trim transparent padding → fixed nearest-neighbor scale per group → **centered by visual center-of-mass** on 280×280 transparent canvas → losslessly compressed with pingo (-s4).

- **Gen7x group** (1,206 sprites): 5x scale (max trimmed sprite: 50×30, widest: Melmetal)
- **Gen8 group** (1,352 sprites): 4x scale (max trimmed sprite: 67×56, widest: Eternatus Eternamax)
- **Gen9 group** (165 sprites): 5x scale (max trimmed sprite: 48×49, tallest: Terapagos Stellar)

Pixel size is consistent within each group, preserving natural size differences between Pokémon. Includes all forms (megas, regional variants, alternate forms), gender variants (`female/` subdir), and right-facing sprites (`right/` subdir, gen7x only).

**Center-of-mass centering:** Instead of centering the bounding box, we compute the centroid of all opaque pixels (visual center of gravity) and align that to the canvas center. This makes sprites look visually balanced — e.g., a Pokémon with a long tail won't appear off-center. The offset is clamped so no part of the sprite is ever cropped off the canvas edge.

### What Didn't Work (Tried 2026-03-03)

1. **Auto-crop + scale-to-fit 112px on 128×128** — gave each sprite a different pixel size (small Pokémon scaled more than large ones). Toxtricity looked wonky.
2. **Raw 68×56 originals, no processing** — gen8+ sprites looked fine but gen7x sprites were too small for Notion icons.
3. **Raw 68×56 centered on 128×128** — still too small.
4. **Fixed 4x scale WITHOUT trimming on 280×280** — too much transparent padding in the source sprites made everything tiny.
5. **Fixed 5x scale WITH trimming on 280×280 (all sprites same scale)** — still too small because the gen8+ sprites (max 47px trimmed) limited the scale factor for everyone.
6. **Per-group scaling (7x/5x) WITH trimming on 280×280, bounding-box centering** — sprites not visually centered (asymmetric features like tails/crests pulled the apparent center off).
7. **Per-group scaling (7x/5x) WITH trimming on 280×280, center-of-mass centering** — visually centered and consistent but only for 76 team sprites.
8. **Per-group scaling (5x/4x/5x) WITH trimming on 280×280, center-of-mass centering, ALL sprites** — current approach. Expanded to all ~2,721 Pokémon. Scale factors lowered to accommodate largest sprites in each group (Melmetal 50px wide in gen7x, Eternatus Eternamax 67×56 in gen8).

### Cache Busting for Notion

Notion caches external icon URLs aggressively. To force refresh after pushing new sprites, reset all icons via the API with `?v=<timestamp>` appended to the URL. This makes Notion treat it as a new URL and re-fetch.

## Sprite Sources & Repo Structure

| Repo Folder      | Source Repo            | Source Directory         | Sprites | Scale | Art Style   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `pokemon-gen7x/` | `msikma/pokesprite`    | `pokemon-gen7x/regular/` | 1,206   | 5x    | SM/USUM     |
| `pokemon-gen8/`  | `msikma/pokesprite`    | `pokemon-gen8/regular/`  | 1,352   | 4x    | SwSh        |
| `pokemon-gen9/`  | `bamq/pokemon-sprites` | `pokemon/regular/`       | 165     | 5x    | SV          |

All source sprites are 68×56. Filenames mirror the source repos exactly.

Subdirectories: `female/` (gender-variant sprites), `right/` (right-facing, gen7x only).

### Notion icon mapping (by game)

| Games (current numbering) | Titles | Icon Source |
|--------------------------|--------|-------------|
| 1-10 | Platinum, Ruby, Black, Sun, FireRed, HeartGold, White 2, Alpha Sapphire, Ultra Moon, Y | `pokemon-gen7x/` |
| 11-12 | Shield, Legends Arceus | `pokemon-gen8/` (Staraptor: gen7x) |
| 13 | Scarlet | `pokemon-gen9/` |
